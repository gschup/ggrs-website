## Bevy

The ðŸ‘‰[Bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org/) is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust, emplyoing the
ðŸ‘‰[ECS paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system). It is free and Open Source!

The plugin is currently being developed and is available on ðŸ‘‰[GitHub](https://github.com/gschup/bevy_ggrs).
